# freewhisk
A whisker tracking algorithm specialized for freely moving, untrimmed mice. 

There are multiple sophisticated algorithms out there for tracking the shape and displacement of whiskers in rodents, which they use to sense their tactile surroundings. The mouse whisker system has indeed become a popular neuroscientific model to study tactile sensory processing. Whilst most neuroscientific research in this field of study has been performed in head-fixed animals, in part due to the greater control over experimental conditions, technological developments are starting to allow us to record neuronal activity in freely moving animals.
